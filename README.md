## About Us
Welcome to Docc, a Doctor Companion at your service 25 hours a day (you see what we did here? ). We use machine learning to predict tuberculosis, pneumonia in the lungs, and brain tumors. In the future, we will expand to skin diseases and many more. Besides, we also have an AI chatbot capable of answering your health needs.  

## Our Services
Currently, we offer you three services:
1. Analyze your Lungs for tuberculosis.
2. Analyze your Lungs for Pneumonia.
3. Analyze your Brain for tumors.

## AI Bot
The AI bot we created is an agentic RAG that leverages disease symptoms to generate answer. We are using a llama3.2 3b model as our LLM with LangGraph helping us create an agentic RAG. The agent also has a memory, that gets activated once you achieve 3 successful interactions.

## Tech
**Frontend**: We are using NextJs for our frontend.

**Backend**: We are using Flask as our backend api
